            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                In math, there are a few universal constants that show up over and over again. Perhaps the most famous one is \(\pi= 3.1415...\), the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.
                However, the second most famous constant is arguably \(e=2.7182...\) \(e\) is the exponential number, often called Euler's number. \(e\) is defined as 
                \[
                \begin{align*}
                e&=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}=1+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{1\times 2}+\frac{1}{1\times 2\times 3}+... \\
                &= \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^n
                \end{align*}
                \]

                We can also write \(\frac{1}{e}\) as 
                \[
                \frac{1}{e} = \lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n
                \]
                What if I told you that you could calculate \(e\), one of the most famous numbers in the world, by tapping?
            </p>
            <h3>Finding \(e\) in One in a Trillion</h3>
            <p>
                In this game, everything is luck-based. As the name implies, everything relies on "one in a __" odds.
                Let's consider the main gameplay loop. Let's assume the probabilies reported by the game reflect the true probabilities. That is, every time you tap, you have a \(\frac{1}{250}\) chance to see a 1 in 250 egg.
            </p>
            <p>Then, we can think of all the random events in the game as "coin flips" where landing on heads would mean hitting the "one in a __" odds and tails means missing.
                Random events like these have been studied extensively by statisticians. So much so that their process has been formally defined as a <b>Bernoulli</b> distribution. 
                The Bernoulli distribution can be used to mathematically define the odds of achieving a "one in a ___" event on a single tap. It is defined as 

                \[P(X=1)=p\]

                \[P(X=0)=1-p\]

                where \(p\) is the probability of success and \(X\) is a binary outcome where 1 is a success, e.g., heads.
                In this game, we can use this to define the odds of finding a one in 250 egg, for example, as follows.

                \[P(\text{250 spawns})=\frac{1}{250}\]

                \[P(\text{250 does not spawn})=1-\frac{1}{250}=\frac{249}{250}\]
            </p>
            <p>
                So far, this may be pretty obvious and \(e\) doesn't show up anywhere. However, in the game, we don't just do a single tap. Instead, we do often do hundreds of thousands of taps a day. 
                Let's look at the abstraction of the Bernoulli distribution for more than one "coin flip", known as the <b>Binomial</b> distribution.
                
                \[P(X=k)={n \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\]

                where \(k\) represents the number of successes in \(n\) trials. In the game, imagine that you want to know the odds of not finding a 1 in 250 egg in 200 taps. Then, we can plug it into the formula as 

                \[
                \begin{align*} 
                P(X=0)&={200 \choose 0}\left(\frac{1}{250}\right)^0\left(\frac{249}{250}\right)^{200-0}\\
                &= 1 \times 1 \times 0.996^{200} \\
                &\approx 0.449
                \end{align*}\]

                So there is about a 45% chance of not finding a 1 in 250 egg in 200 taps! We still haven't seen \(e\), but this is necessary background and we're almost there!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, let's consider the odds of not finding a 1 in \(n\) egg in \(n\) taps.

                \[
                \begin{align*} 
                P(X=0)&={n \choose 0}\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^0\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n}\\
                &= 1 \times 1 \times \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n} \\
                &= \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^{n} \\
                \end{align*}\]
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, what if we repeat this process a large amount of times? We perform \(n\) taps to get a 1 in \(n\) egg over and over again. Then,

                \[
                \begin{align*} 
                \lim_{n\to\infty} P(X=0)&=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n
                \end{align*}\]

                Now, recall the definition of \(e\) from the introductory paragraph!

                \[
                \begin{align*} 
                \lim_{n\to\infty} P(X=0)&=\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)^n \\
                &= \frac{1}{e}
                \end{align*}\]

                And there it is! By calculating the chance of not getting a "one in a ___" egg over a large amount of taps, we have found \(e\)!
            </p>
            <h3>Calculating it in the Game</h3>
            <p>
                Now that we have done the math to find \(e\), calculating it in the game is actually really simple! Below are some ways you can do it.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Tapping gems:</b> assume that gems are actually 1 in 25 rarity. Then, tap 25 times. If a gem ever spawns in those 25 taps, mark that down and restart. 
                    If it does not spawn in 25 taps, mark that down and restart. (Keep in mind tapping a gem or egg does not count towards your taps.) Continue this as long as you want, keeping track of how many times a gem spawned and how many times a gem did not spawn.
                    Then, do 
                    \[\frac{\text{total number of attempts you did}}{\text{number of times a gem did not spawn}}\]
                    
                    You should see that this gets closer and closer to \(e\) the more attempts you do!
                </li>
                <li><b>Tapping eggs:</b> if you do not buy that gems are 1 in 25, you can try this with a rarity of egg, like 1 in 250. Simply follow the process above for 250 taps instead of 25.</li>
                <li><b>Scrambles or frenzies:</b> put an exact amount of sauce correlating to an egg rarity on a scramble or frenzy egg, for example 250k sauce. Then, see if an egg of that rarity ever shows up during the scramble or frenzy. 
                    Follow the process above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To show that this works, I simulated this process a few times myself using a more efficient version of the gem tapping method. In 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1,000 taps</b> I got \(2.6\)</li>
                    <li><b>10,000 taps</b> I got \(2.766\)</li>
                    <li><b>100,000 taps</b> I got \(2.751\)</li>
                </ul>

                Although this is not exactly \(e\approx 2.718\), we can get pretty close in a reasonable amount of taps!
